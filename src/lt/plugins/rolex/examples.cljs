;; TODO: Lenses
;;
;; Lenses are basically just a function with one arg that transforms a value
;; and then passes it on to the next lense. They can be composed with the :rolex.watch.with-lenses
;; command.
;;
;; The lense macro is basicaly just a wrapper around the behavior macro to make defining them
;; a little easier.
;;
;; Ex: Keymap binding to combine ltobject summarization and values over time
;;
;;   :editor {"alt-w" [(:rolex.watch.with-lenses :->ltsummarize :->values-over-time )]}
